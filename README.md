- 👋 Hi, I’m @StBrian47
- 👀 I’m interested in fusion energy, scientific simulations, and advanced computational tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning COMSOL for plasma simulation and deepening my knowledge in magnetic confinement systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fusion research, physics-based simulations, and innovative energy projects
- 📫 How to reach me brian_estigarribia47@hotmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an electromechanical technician, and almost everything I know to design the Aurora reactor was learned through self-study and curiosity. If anyone can help me with numerical simulations or correct me on any topic, I’d really appreciate it!
